/**
 * Provides a way for a {@link ComputedFolder} to break the association between the directory names on disk
 * that are used to store its items and the {@link Item#getName()} which is used to create the URL of the item.
 * <p>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> if you need to implement this functionality, you need to ensure that users cannot rename
 * items within the {@link ComputedFolder} as renaming is not supported when using a {@link ChildNameGenerator}.
 * <p>
 * Challenges:
 * <ul>
 * <li>See the notes on {@link #itemNameFromItem(AbstractFolder, TopLevelItem)} and
 * {@link #dirNameFromItem(AbstractFolder, TopLevelItem)} regarding the constraints on how to name things</li>
 * <li>There are some items which need the {@link Item#getRootDir()} during construction (those are bold evil item types
 * that leak side-effects, you should fix them if you find them). While you wait for them to be fixed you will need
 * to work-around the issue by ensuring that you call {@link #beforeCreateItem(AbstractFolder, String, String)}
 * passing the {@link Item#getName()} you want the item to have <strong>and</strong> the ideal unmangled name
 * <strong>before</strong> you call {@code new ChildItemType(parent,name)} and then call
 * {@link #afterItemCreated(Trace)} when the constructor has returned. Then insure that your
 * {@link #itemNameFromItem(AbstractFolder, TopLevelItem)} and {@link #dirNameFromItem(AbstractFolder, TopLevelItem)}
 * fall back to {@link #idealNameFromItem(AbstractFolder, TopLevelItem)} when the magic property they are looking
 * for is missing.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * For a valid implementation, the
 * {@link ComputedFolder} using this {@link ChildNameGenerator} will be attaching into the {@link Item} the
 * actual name, typically via a {@link JobProperty} or {@link Action} (beware {@link TransientActionFactory}
 * implementations may want to invoke {@link Item#getRootDir()} which will trigger a stack overflow though, so
 * safer to stick with the {@link JobProperty} or equivalent). The
 * {@link #itemNameFromItem(AbstractFolder, TopLevelItem)} method's task is to find the stored name
 * and return the name stored within or {@code null} if that information is missing (in which case
 * {@link #itemNameFromLegacy(AbstractFolder, String)} will be called to try and infer the name from the
 * disk name that the {@link Item} is being loaded from.
 * A similar relation exists for the {@link #dirNameFromItem(AbstractFolder, TopLevelItem)} and
 * {@link #dirNameFromLegacy(AbstractFolder, String)} methods.
 *
 * @param <P> the type of {@link AbstractFolder}.
 * @param <I> the type of {@link TopLevelItem} within the folder.
 * @since 5.17
